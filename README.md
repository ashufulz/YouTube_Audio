# YouTube_Audio

Downloading YouTube audios/videos through pytube library


In the 'vid_url' you can directly specify youtube link.
I had multiple files so I went for loop controls.


'filename_prefix' = 'abc':
adds 'abc' as prefix of the filename and saves it in that format.

'filename_prefix' = '':
This saves the filename in the same exact format as the title is.
